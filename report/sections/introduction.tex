% Introduction Section

%% Development Plan for Introduction:

%% 1. Background and Context (1-2 paragraphs)
%%    - Brief overview of football/soccer and Premier League
%%    - Importance of match outcome prediction
%%    - Applications: betting, team strategy, fan engagement
%%    - Economic and sporting significance

%% 2. Problem Statement (1 paragraph)
%%    - Clearly define the prediction task
%%    - Three-class classification: Home Win (H), Draw (D), Away Win (A)
%%    - Challenges: complexity of sports prediction, many influencing factors
%%    - Dataset: EPL matches from 2000-2024

%% 3. Motivation (1 paragraph)
%%    - Why is this problem interesting?
%%    - What makes it challenging?
%%    - Real-world applications and impact
%%    - Machine learning advantages over traditional methods

%% 4. Objectives (bullet points or paragraph)
%%    - Develop accurate prediction model for EPL match outcomes
%%    - Engineer meaningful features from historical match data
%%    - Compare multiple machine learning algorithms
%%    - Interpret model predictions and identify key factors
%%    - Achieve better performance than baseline methods

%% 5. Dataset Overview (1 paragraph)
%%    - Source and time period of data
%%    - Number of matches and features
%%    - Key variables: goals, shots, fouls, cards, etc.
%%    - Train/test split information

%% 6. Approach Summary (1 paragraph)
%%    - High-level overview of methodology
%%    - Main steps: EDA, feature engineering, model training, evaluation
%%    - Models considered: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, etc.
%%    - Evaluation metrics: accuracy, F1-score, etc.

%% 7. Report Structure (1 paragraph)
%%    - Brief outline of remaining sections
%%    - Guide reader through the report

%% Expected Length: 1.5-2 pages

%% Key Points to Address:
%% - Make it engaging and establish importance
%% - Clearly define problem and objectives
%% - Set up reader expectations
%% - Avoid technical details (save for methodology)
%% - Include relevant citations to sports analytics literature
