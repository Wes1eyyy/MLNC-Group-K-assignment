% Discussion Section

%% Development Plan for Discussion:

%% 1. Summary of Findings (1-2 paragraphs)
%%    - Recap main results
%%    - Best model and performance achieved
%%    - Key insights from analysis

%% 2. Interpretation of Results (subsection)
%%    2.1 Why Does the Model Work?
%%        - What makes the best model successful?
%%        - Which features drive predictions most?
%%        - How do results align with domain knowledge?
%%        - Validation of football analytics intuitions
%%    
%%    2.2 Home Advantage
%%        - How well did model capture home advantage?
%%        - Is it consistent with observed patterns?
%%    
%%    2.3 Form vs Historical Performance
%%        - Which matters more: recent form or overall stats?
%%        - Insights about team dynamics

%% 3. Comparison with Expectations (subsection)
%%    3.1 Hypothesis Validation
%%        - Initial hypotheses about important features
%%        - Which were confirmed? Which were wrong?
%%    
%%    3.2 Surprising Results
%%        - Unexpected findings
%%        - Features that didn't matter as expected
%%        - Possible explanations

%% 4. Limitations (subsection)
%%    4.1 Data Limitations
%%        - Missing information (injuries, transfers, tactics)
%%        - Data quality issues if any
%%        - Historical data may not reflect current game
%%    
%%    4.2 Model Limitations
%%        - Inherent unpredictability in sports
%%        - Model assumptions and constraints
%%        - Cases where model fails
%%    
%%    4.3 Feature Engineering Limitations
%%        - Features not considered
%%        - Simplifications made
%%        - Potential improvements

%% 5. Challenges Encountered (subsection)
%%    5.1 Technical Challenges
%%        - Data preprocessing difficulties
%%        - Avoiding data leakage in temporal data
%%        - Handling imbalanced classes (draws less frequent)
%%        - Hyperparameter tuning complexity
%%    
%%    5.2 How Challenges Were Addressed
%%        - Solutions implemented
%%        - Trade-offs made

%% 6. Potential Improvements (subsection)
%%    6.1 Additional Features
%%        - External data: ELO ratings, transfer spending
%%        - Player-level data (injuries, suspensions)
%%        - Weather conditions
%%        - Fixture difficulty
%%    
%%    6.2 Advanced Techniques
%%        - Deep learning approaches (LSTM for sequences)
%%        - Ensemble methods combining multiple models
%%        - Time series forecasting methods
%%        - Bayesian approaches for uncertainty
%%    
%%    6.3 Different Approaches
%%        - Predict goal difference instead of discrete outcome
%%        - Multi-task learning (predict score and outcome)
%%        - Separate models for different team tiers

%% 7. Practical Applications (subsection)
%%    7.1 Real-World Use Cases
%%        - Sports betting strategies
%%        - Team performance analysis
%%        - Match preparation insights
%%        - Fan engagement applications
%%    
%%    7.2 Ethical Considerations
%%        - Responsible use in betting
%%        - Transparency in predictions
%%        - Limitations acknowledgment

%% 8. Broader Implications (subsection)
%%    - Lessons for sports analytics
%%    - Applicability to other leagues/sports
%%    - Role of ML in sports decision-making

%% Expected Length: 2-3 pages

%% Key Points:
%% - Be critical and reflective
%% - Acknowledge limitations honestly
%% - Provide thoughtful interpretation
%% - Connect to broader context
%% - Suggest concrete improvements
%% - Balance technical and domain perspectives
