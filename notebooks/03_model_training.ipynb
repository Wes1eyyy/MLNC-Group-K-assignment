    "\n",
    "## Development Plan\n",
    "\n",
    "### Objectives:\n",
    "- Implement multiple classification models for match outcome prediction\n",
    "- Perform hyperparameter tuning for each model\n",
    "- Use cross-validation to ensure robust evaluation\n",
    "- Compare model performances and select best model\n",
    "\n",
    "### Implementation Steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. Setup and Data Loading\n",
    "- Import necessary ML libraries (sklearn, xgboost, lightgbm, etc.)\n",
    "- Load feature-engineered training data from data/processed/\n",
    "- Separate features (X) and target variable (y - FTR)\n",
    "- Check class balance in target variable\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. Train-Test Split & Cross-Validation Setup\n",
    "- Split data into train/validation sets (time-based split recommended)\n",
    "- Set up K-Fold cross-validation (5 or 10 folds)\n",
    "- Consider stratified CV to maintain class distribution\n",
    "- Define evaluation metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, Log Loss\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. Baseline Model\n",
    "- Implement simple baseline (e.g., most frequent class predictor)\n",
    "- Calculate baseline performance metrics\n",
    "- Use as benchmark for comparing ML models\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4. Logistic Regression\n",
    "- Train multinomial logistic regression\n",
    "- Try different regularization parameters (C values)\n",
    "- Use grid search or random search for hyperparameter tuning\n",
    "- Evaluate using cross-validation\n",
    "- Record best parameters and performance\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 5. Decision Tree\n",
    "- Train decision tree classifier\n",
    "- Tune max_depth, min_samples_split, min_samples_leaf\n",
    "- Use grid search for optimization\n",

    "- Visualize tree structure (if not too complex)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 6. Random Forest\n",
    "- Train random forest classifier\n",
    "- Tune n_estimators, max_depth, min_samples_split, max_features\n",
    "- Use randomized search for efficiency\n",

    "- Train XGBoost classifier\n",
    "- Tune learning_rate, max_depth, n_estimators, subsample, colsample_bytree\n",
    "- Use early stopping to prevent overfitting\n",

    "- Evaluate and record results\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 8. LightGBM (Optional)\n",
    "- Train LightGBM classifier\n",
    "- Tune num_leaves, learning_rate, n_estimators\n",
    "- Compare with XGBoost performance\n",
    "- Evaluate and record results\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 9. Support Vector Machine (Optional)\n",
    "- Train SVM with different kernels (linear, RBF)\n",
    "- Tune C and gamma parameters\n",
    "- Note: May be slow on large datasets\n",
    "- Evaluate and record results\n",

    "- Analyze confusion matrices for each model\n",
    "- Consider both accuracy and computational cost\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 12. Model Selection\n",
    "- Select best performing model based on metrics\n",
    "- Retrain on full training data with best hyperparameters\n",
    "- Save final model to models/ directory\n",
    "- Document model selection rationale\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 13. Save Results\n",
    "- Save all model performance metrics to results/model_comparison.csv\n",
