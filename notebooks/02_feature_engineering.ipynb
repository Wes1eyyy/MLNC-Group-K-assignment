    "# 02 - Feature Engineering\n",
    "\n",
    "## Development Plan\n",
    "\n",
    "### Objectives:\n",
    "- Create meaningful features from raw match statistics\n",
    "- Implement rolling averages and form indicators\n",
    "- Engineer team-specific and head-to-head features\n",
    "- Prepare features for both training and test datasets\n",
    "\n",
    "### Implementation Steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. Data Preprocessing\n",
    "- Load cleaned training data from notebook 01\n",
    "- Sort data chronologically by Date\n",
    "- Handle any remaining missing values\n",
    "- Create season identifier from Date column\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. Basic Team Statistics Features\n",
    "- Overall win rate (total wins / total matches)\n",
    "- Home win rate and away win rate\n",
    "- Average goals scored per match (home and away separately)\n",
    "- Average goals conceded per match\n",
    "- Average shots, shots on target per match\n",
    "- Average fouls, yellow cards, red cards per match\n",
    "- Average corners per match\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. Form-Based Features (Rolling Windows)\n",
    "- Last N matches form (e.g., N=5, 10): wins, points\n",
    "- Rolling average goals scored (last 5/10 matches)\n",
    "- Rolling average goals conceded\n",
    "- Recent performance trend (win rate in last N matches vs overall)\n",
    "- Points from last 5 matches (3 for win, 1 for draw, 0 for loss)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4. Head-to-Head Features\n",
    "- Historical win rate between specific teams\n",
    "- Average goals in matchups between two teams\n",
    "- Last meeting outcome\n",
    "- Home team advantage in this specific matchup\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 5. Time-Based Features\n",
    "- Day of week\n",
    "- Month of year\n",
    "- Season stage (early/mid/late season)\n",
    "- Days since last match (rest days)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 6. Advanced Features\n",
    "- Goal difference (cumulative)\n",
    "- Shot accuracy (shots on target / total shots)\n",
    "- Discipline index (yellow + red cards)\n",
    "- Attack strength vs defense strength\n",
    "- ELO rating (optional, if time permits)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 7. Feature Encoding\n",
    "- Encode team names (label encoding or one-hot encoding)\n",
    "- Encode referee names if used as feature\n",
    "- Create features for both home and away teams\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 8. Feature Selection & Analysis\n",
    "- Calculate correlation with target variable (FTR)\n",
    "- Identify highly correlated features\n",
    "- Remove redundant or low-importance features\n",
    "- Visualize feature distributions\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 9. Apply to Test Data\n",
    "- Load test dataset\n",
    "- Apply same feature engineering pipeline\n",
    "- Ensure consistency in feature creation\n",
    "- Handle any missing historical data for test matches\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 10. Save Processed Data\n",
    "- Save feature-engineered training data to data/processed/\n",
    "- Save feature-engineered test data\n",
    "- Export feature list and descriptions\n",
    "\n",
    "### Expected Outputs:\n",
    "- features_training.csv with all engineered features\n",
    "- features_test.csv ready for prediction\n",
    "- feature_descriptions.txt documenting each feature\n",
    "- Correlation analysis plots in figures/feature_analysis/\n",
    "- Feature importance preliminary analysis"
